  - SDLC is a process for Developing Software
  - step by step procedure
  - design and develop high quality product
  - good quality product and software
  - produce intermediate products how the customer needs
  - it is a structured way to creat and de software
  - high quality and lowest cost to short time
  - diff phases each has its process and activity
  - design create deliver
  - phase to phase
  - requirement to design to dev to test and given client
  - SDLS is a systematic process
  
  - SDLC;
    - requirement phase
    - desgin phase
    - build/dev phase
    - twsting phase
    - deployment delier phase
    
    - maintenence
      - requirement;
        - dev team and project manager work togerhet
        - client specify requirements, specification, expectation, any needs related
        - business mang and project managg gather all info
        - info gethering this phase is also imp for the future of project
        - needs clear understanding
        - clear define and document all the reeq and approve by customer and by market analyst
        - Software Requirement Specification SRS is an imp document
          - detailed document and agreemenr between custoemr and contractor, include how user interact with the system
          - introduction; purpose, def, system overview, scope of work, references
          - overall description; product perspective, funsctions, constraints, dependencies, assuumptions, hadware, software intef, 
          - specifiq req; external interface rq, funcc rq, performance req, db rq, software sytem atributte, reliablty, avaliablity, sec, main, portable, etc.


       - Design
          - comng info from SRS transmit to designers
          - logical desgining if system converting to phsycal disigning
          - accomplish the rq from SRS
          - decision for tools like programing languagge, database, combination of harware, and software.
          - using flowcharts, Data flow diagram(DFD), Data dic, Structure english, desicion table, deision tree.
          
        - Build/ Develeopment
          -  implementation of desig to software system
          -  coding phase
          -  build entire system by coding with decided programing language
          -  task are divided into small units and modules
          -  longest phase of SDLC
          -  needs focused phase by developers
         
        -  Testing Phase
          - when software is completed time to test
          - investigation and iscovery
          - functionality of  entire system
          - if req is fine or not
          - dev team make a test plan
          - integration test, unit test, acceptence test and system testing
          - is there a bug orr not
          - works as expected or not
          - make fixation and it ll finish   
         
        - Deployment/Deliver Phase  
          - if it is complate time to deliver to customer
          - needs beta testing
          - customer may needs changes
          - may encounter defect to handle again
          - dev team will solve these problems
          - if it is cruciel it is urgent and needs to be solved in a short time or it willl be solve in next version
          - and now all the issues solved start to deploy end-user
        
        - Maintenence
          - it will continue until to software life is end
          -  maintain it operational effectiveness, enhance securoty, 


  -  SDLC Models
    - how to activities relate logically and chronologically to each other
    - each model diff test procedure
    - Softwar dev and soft testing
      - evry deployment needs new testing
      - each test level has its specific ovjectives
      - test analysis given to the dev team again
      - testers participate discussion next define and redifine phase
      - best practice is starttesting early phases
    - verification and validation
      - verf for is the deliverable built according to the specification
      - validation is for is the deliverable fit for purpose and does it provide a solution to the problem
